design idea B&amp;P introduced in the strand of the EU project Learning
Layers<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >In order to reflect the bipolarity of sensemaking the B&amp;P user interface consists of
two types of view components (widgets) displayed in two vertically arranged
canvases. The upper canvas is reserved for widgets which enable users to browse
(forage for) their digital artifacts along contextual cues (eg. time, location, topics)
whereas the lower canvas gives space to widgets for organizing these items
semantically.

<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" ></div><hr class="endfigure">
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Whether a tool for sensemaking is appropriate mainly depends on the context, eg.
the kind of data, the specific goal, the user&#8217;s personal preferences, and so on.
Furthermore, as the data represent informal learning experiences they can not be
defined by a certain type or structure. On the one hand they may vary in
their intrinsic properties (textual notes, photos, audio records, etc.), on the
other hand in their extrinsic ones (creation time, location, relation to other
items etc.). Hence, the design envisions the contents of both canvases to be
switchable over an extensible set of widgets dynamically and independently in
order to find the appropriate ones to visualize and interact with the data at
hand.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Both the division into two canvases and the dynamic switching feature account for
reciprocity of sensemaking. First, the organize canvas can be used to build up
representations based on the data in the browse canvas whereas the browsing can be
guided by representations present in the organize canvas. On the other hand,
switching of widgets also allows for the reciprocal interchange of top-down and
bottom-up processes as widgets as a whole can be seen as a representation of data,
be it a browsing widget or an organizing one. Given the widget seems unsuitable for
the data, the user can switch (<span 
class="cmti-12">shift</span>) it. Additionally reciprocity can be supported
by recommender systems suggesting further data given a representation (or a
widget) as well as suggesting a representation (or a widget) given a data
set.
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >As sensemaking is enactive, the interface needs to yield interactive affordances.
Therefore our design enables users to interact with each visible element. Generally,
items can be dragged and dropped from the upper to the lower canvas and each
item can be clicked on demand for detail information. Furthermore, the design
suggests a couple of specific widgets for each canvas each being interactive
respectively. On the one hand, for instance, the timeline widget for the upper
canvas can be panned and zoomed, on the other hand the lower canvas may contain
an organizing widget for drawing rings and arranging items like in a Venn
diagram.
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >On account of the episodic and heterogeneous nature of informal learning (Eraut,
2004), users need to be able to separate sensemaking according to different
learning needs and easily switch between them. Hence, the label of the
current learning topic is displayed in the header of the application. Via a
                                                                            

                                                                            
dropdown menu new topics can be created and switched to quickly provide
anchors to the corresponding sensemaking states. Due to sensemaking&#8217;s
quality of continuity users may cease sensemaking as soon as they see their
task-specific goal achieved (Russell et al., 1993) or may come back later.
Therefore, these sensemaking states need to be persisted continuously at
runtime.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >Summing up, the corner stones of our design are the following, each tackling a
specific quality of sensemaking:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">two canvases (bipolarity)
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">widget-based extensibility (context-sensitivity, reciprocity)
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">interactive affordances (enactivity)
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">continuous preservation of state (continuity)</li></ul>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >The individuality of sensemaking is covered a priori as informal learning experiences
are personal per se. Reification is not considered in the design as such as this
quality is a matter of data and hence can not be represented on the level of
design.
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.2</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-60001.1.2"></a>Non-Functional Requirements</h4>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >The following non-functional requirements are direct implications of the corner
stones of our design. As our approach goes for a generic framework we exclude
functional requirements here which are specific to concrete sensemaking tasks and
have already been elaborated by others (Gotz, 2007; Ryder and Anderson, 2009;
Paul and Morris, 2009; Horng et al., 2011).
                                                                            

                                                                            
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">On account of the extensibility widgets need to be <span 
class="cmti-12">independent </span>modules
      each tackling a specific aspect of data or functionality. Independence
      maximizes the number of possible combinations of widgets and thereby
      the  adaptability  to  the  specific  sensemaking  objection.  Furthermore
      independence of widgets makes switching between them flawless.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Interactivity requires <span 
class="cmti-12">responsiveness</span>, ie. the application has to respond
      to user input immediately without passing on time consuming loading
      and processing times to the user&#8217;s experience. On the one hand this
      implies that every visible bit needs to respond to any user action which
      is executed upon it. On the other hand data loading and processing logic
      needs to be decoupled from the visual frontend completely.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">In order to support continuous preservation the application&#8217;s state needs
      to be <span 
class="cmti-12">serializable </span>at any point. This further implies that any operation
      triggered upon the data has to be atomic in order to make inconsistent
      (ie.  unserializable)  states  impossible.  Instead  consistency  of  the  data
      must not be provided on a technical (low) level but on a semantic (high)
      level. This also ensures that the application cannot break technically and
      hence become unusable.</li></ul>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >These requirements have some technical consequences. If widgets have to be
independent modules there needs to be a common means of data exchange in order
to enable communication with the framework and inter-widget coordination.
However, the type and structure of data can not be defined a priori and thus a
common data format either. Hence, a graph-like database is necessary as it
does not impose any pre-defined structure apart from nodes and links.
Furthermore, graphs can represent reification which is also a quality of
sensemaking.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-70001.2"></a>Implementation</h3>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >The implementation of the prototype is split into two parts. On account of the
generic requirements described above a framework for use case agnostic features was
developed. The framework is intended to ease the implementation of application
specific widgets which can leverage the modularity, responsiveness and
serializability provided. The main part of this section is concerned with the
framework implementation. As an application two widgets of the Bits and Pieces
design idea have been developed on top of this framework.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.1</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-80001.2.1"></a>Environment</h4>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >The framework relies on the runtime environment of web browsers. The decision to
use the web browser as the application platform has several reasons. First, as the
Bits and Pieces framework aims to facilitate sensemaking on the web, the web
browser itself renders the runtime enviroment for this purpose. Second,
HTML5<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="docu3.html#fn2x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-8001f2"></a>  together

href="docu4.html#fn3x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-8002f3"></a> 
provides a feature rich framework for structuring, integrating and presenting
multimedia content. It comes as the W3C web standard implemented across various
web browsers. Third, web applications running natively in the web browser relieve
users from awkward installation requirements. Furthermore as web browsers are
pre-installed on nowadays operating systems such applications let users
step into their sensemaking process free from technical barriers related to
software.
                                                                            

                                                                            
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >JavaScript is the programming language commonly used for web application
programming. On top of the browser&#8217;s runtime environment, it deals with the
aforementioned requirements out of the box. As for the common interface for
inter-module communication, the events API of the Document Object Model
(DOM)<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="docu5.html#fn4x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-8003f4"></a> 
can be used to trigger and listen for application wide events which allow to transmit
data objects between modules. The same mechanism enables interactivity as user

outbound communication is provided by the &#8221;Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

technique. The DOM tree, ie. the hierarchical HTML5 structure of the user
interface elements, offers fine-grained access to the presentation layer as visual
elements can be addressed and updated directly. Most importantly JavaScript is a
dynamic scripting language which needs no compilation of its sources. Hence
objects can be extended by additional properties at runtime which is especially
handy in the given case of unstructured data.
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >However, these are low-level features of the language which are delicate to use in a
productive environment. For instance, the manipulation of the DOM tree, the
handling of events and the invocation of Ajax calls requires a considerable amount
of code for relatively simple tasks. Moreover, there is no communication
channel like the DOM events for JavaScript objects and understandably the
language does not ship with a graph database. For these reasons, a couple of
open-source JavaScript frameworks have been used to ease the prototype
development.

consists of four concepts which are relevant for the prototype. Web developers can
extend <span 
class="cmtt-12">Backbone.Model </span>which bundles logic for creation, access, alteration and
deletion of objects. <span 
class="cmtt-12">Backbone.Collection </span>is needed for logic at the level of
collections of models, for instance retrieval, addition and removal of objects. Models
can be bound to a <span 
class="cmtt-12">Backbone.View </span>, which cares for the presentation in
HTML5. A view also keeps a reference to the DOM element where it puts
model data to. Moreover, Backbone enriches models and collections with an
event mechanism similar to DOM events. For instance, a view can listen
to changes to a model and trigger the appropriate functions to redraw
the associated DOM element. A collection also fires events in the case of
any operations invoked on it, eg. when adding a new object. Additionally
<span 
class="cmtt-12">Backbone.Model </span>provides a generic API for synchronizing data with external
sources.

provides a high-level API on top of JavaScript to simplify the traversal of the DOM
tree, the retrieval of specific DOM elements and thus their manipulation. It also
reduces the amount of code for the binding and unbinding of event listeners to the
DOM which is needed by the prototype for the inter-widget communication.

is the so-called semantic interaction framework which brings together Backbone and
the semantic web (Grünwald and Bergius, 2012). As the re-implementation of a
graph database in JavaScript would neither be feasible nor high-performing VIE
offers an entity-centric view of the semantic data based on JSON-LD (see <a 
href="#x1-160001.2.2">1.2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: means_sem_ia --></a>). On
top of Backbone it mimics a graph database by implementing <span

class="cmtt-12">VIE.Collection </span>which
is a type of <span 
class="cmtt-12">Backbone.Collection</span>. Every property of an entity is a URI and
any entity can be retrieved from the collection by its subject URI. VIE
enables developers to build interactive web applications on top of semantic
data.

(Westenthaler and Grisel, 2012). Remote services are called asynchronously through the
aforementioned Ajax technique, which means that the application continues running
without waiting for the response from the server. However, utilizing the JQuery Deferred

<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >The data layer is organized in modules each handling an aspect of the
application data. Modules may trigger data operation on each other to

data modules for a hierarchical data model can listen to certain entities
being added to the entity collection and trigger the loading of its child
entities.
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >The VIE framework provides the data layer with utility functionality for dealing
with semantic data. As all entities are of the type <span 
class="cmtt-12">VIE.Entity </span>and kept in a single
<span 
class="cmtt-12">VIE.Collection </span>(see fig. <span 
class="cmbx-12">??</span>) they are subject to VIE&#8217;s semantic utility framework.
For instance, an entity can be retrieved either by its URI or its CURIE which is a
concatenation of a local namespace prefix with the entity specific part of its URI.
Moreover, given a type hierarchy VIE can localize an entity&#8217;s type URI within that
hierarchy.
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >Due to the service layer&#8217;s asynchronous nature the data layer keeps application
data coherent and synchronous with the presentation layer which needs to
serve immediate response to the user despite time-consuming asynchronous
service operations. For instance, in the case of loading entities the data layer
may provide the presentation layer with preliminary mockup data which
function as a placeholder for the real entities being loaded through the service
layer. In the case of the creation of an entity the data layer may create
a representation of it which exists merely on the client-side by giving it
a blank node URI of the form <span 
class="cmtt-12">_:b</span><span 
class="cmti-12">N</span>with a <span 
class="cmti-12">N </span>being some serial number.
As soon as the service layer hands back the response of the server-side
creation of the entity containing its real URI the data layer should update
the client-side representation. See fig. <a

Alternatively a view may also listen to new entities added to the entity

implement meaningful visualization techniques and interaction affordances
on top of the semantics of a bit. The interface of the DOM tree provides
fine-granular access to respective DOM elements for either manipulating
its contents or listening for user events triggered upon it. According to
Backbone a view also handles user input and hence takes the role of a controller
to some extend. For instance, it is feasible to have a main view module
which controls the instantiation of other views. However, as the views are
not specific to the framework, view logic is up to the application specific
development.

Evernote covers even more functionalities to record informal learning experiences
