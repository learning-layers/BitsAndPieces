* opening of external application wtih file contained in the entity
    * how to determine which property references the file?
    * what do to if there isn't a file?

    * data structure for storing versions of the interface 
        * episode
        * episode has many versions, has a label
        * version has some representation of the application and a time of creation of the version
    * dropdown menu for listing, creating, updating and deleting of episodes as such
        * and of the versions with delete option
        * clicking on a version rebuilds the user interface of the application 
    * user scenario:
        * user creates epsisode
        * user does something
        * the "something" is stored to the episode implicitly
        * the user saves explicitly -> a new version of epsiode is stored
* user events tracking for activity  streams




* sharing?

* bugs:
    * putting circle upon item

* Evernote authentication needed to get the data from it per user

* user identification by our application
